# How to identify?

# Staircase pattern is very useful to solve Dynamic Programming problems 
# involving minimum/maximum steps, jumps, stairs, 
# fibonacci numbers etc. to reach a target

# Problem: Climbing Stairs
# LeetCode 70 - Climbing Stairs [easy]

# You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# Note:

# Given n will be a positive integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# --> 1 step + 1 step
# --> 2 steps
# Example 2:

# Input: 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# --> 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# --> 1 step + 2 steps
# --> 2 steps + 1 step

# Brute Force Solution
# At every step, we have two options: either climb 1 step or 2 steps.

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # we don't take any steps, so there is only 1 way
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        # we can take one step to reach the end, and this is the only way
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        # we can take one step twice or take two steps to reach the end
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        # if we take one step, we are left with "n - 1" steps
        take1step = self.climbStairs(n - 1)
        # if we take two steps, we are left with "n - 2" steps
        take2steps = self.climbStairs(n - 2)

        return take1step + take2steps
# Time Complexity: O(2N) because we are making 2 recursive calls in the same function.

# Space Complexity: O(N) which is used to store the recursion stack.

# Top-down Dynamic Programming with Memoization
# We can use an array to store already solved sub-problems.

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for x in range(n+1)]
        return self.climbStairs_recursive(dp, n)
    
    def climbStairs_recursive(self, dp, n):
        # we don't take any steps, so there is only 1 way
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        # we can take one step to reach the end, and this is the only way
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        # we can take one step twice or take two steps to reach the end
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        
        if dp[n] == 0:
            # if we take one step, we are left with "n - 1" steps
            take1step = self.climbStairs_recursive(dp, n - 1)
            # if we take two steps, we are left with "n - 2" steps
            take2steps = self.climbStairs_recursive(dp, n - 2)
            
            dp[n] = take1step + take2steps
            
        return dp[n]
# Time Complexity: O(N) because memoization array dp[n+1] stores the results of all sub-problems. We can conclude that we will not have more than n + 1 sub-problems.

# Space Complexity: O(N) which is used to store the recursion stack.

# Bottom-up Dynamic Programming with Tabulation
# Letâ€™s try to populate our dp[] array in a bottom-up fashion. As we see from the recursion stack visualization, each climbStairs(n) call is the sum of the two previous calls.

# We can use this fact while populating our dp[] array.

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for x in range(n+1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        
        return dp[n]
# Time Complexity: O(N)
# Space Complexity: O(N) which is used to store the recursion stack.

n = 6
s = Solution().climbStairs(n)
print(s)


# Memory Optimization
# As we can see from the visualization of the recursive stack and other solutions, to be able to calculate the n, you need the value of last two combinations: n-1 and n-2.

# These two values are enough and we donâ€™t need to store all other past combinations.

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        first = 1  # how many step possibilities there are with 1 stairs
        second = 2  # how many step possibilities there are with 2 stairs
        third = 0

        for _ in range(2, n):
            third = first + second
            first = second  # walk up first to second
            second = third  # walk up second to third
        return third
# OR more shortly;

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        a = b = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
