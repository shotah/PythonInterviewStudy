# LeetCode 1192 - Critical Connections in a Network [hard]

# There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

# A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

# Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

# Example 1:

# Critical Connections

# Input: n = 4, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [1, 3]]
# Output: [[1, 3]]
# Explanation: [[3, 1]] is also accepted.
# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 105
# n-1 <= connections.length <= 105
# connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
# There are no repeated connections.
